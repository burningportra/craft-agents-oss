## Voice principles

### To-the-point
Overview: Clear, mission-driven. Break down financial lingo. Build confidence with information.

Tactics:
- Never bury the lead: start with the most important information.
- Clarity first (style second): structure and language make purpose unmistakable.

Should be: Clear, Focused, Organised, Curated, Confident, Empowering  
Should not be: Sparse, Cold, Boring, Lifeless, Dull, Vague

Additional guidance:
- Guide with confidence: explain how things work and what to expect. Inform, then direct.
- Build familiarity: repeat conventions so experiences are easy to recognise.

### Approachable
Overview: Imaginative and inviting. No jargon, ego, or cheap emotion.

Tactics:
- Read the room: understand what the customer wants, needs, and feels.
- Act as a translator: make the complex simple; show personality where appropriate.

Should be: Self-aware, Conversational, Responsive, Reliable, Supportive, Innovative, Optimistic  
Should not be: Overfamiliar, Chatty, Childish, Distant, Sensational, Unattainable, Exclusive

Additional guidance:
- Be inventive: challenge conventions without “Simple! Fast! Free!” traps.
- Write inclusively: accessible to screen readers, keyboard navigation, all cognitive abilities.
- Use humour precisely: no memes, internet-speak, puns, snark, or canned quips.

### Upfront
Overview: Tell it like it is while imagining how it could be. Honest and transparent.

Tactics:
- Tell the whole truth: be honest about products, processes, and policies.
- Balance humility and confidence: show strengths while acknowledging limits.

Should be: Candid, Sincere, Accountable, Responsible, Genuine, Empathetic  
Should not be: Technical, Fear-mongering, Academic

Additional guidance:
- Use friction: when stakes are high, slow things down.
